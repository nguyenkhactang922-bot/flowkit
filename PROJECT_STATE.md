previous_stage = DISCOVERY / CURRENT STATE AUDIT

### Verified in repository source

- Workspace and Git identity were verified from the live checkout.
- Runtime topology was verified as FastAPI + SQLite + Chrome MV3 extension + React/Vite dashboard.
- No Electron runtime was found.
- No root src/ directory exists; source is split across agent/, dashboard/src/, extension/, skills/, and tests/.
- Entity/reference generation, media persistence, Flow/Omni transport, request queue, retry/resume behavior, and rendered-video QA were inspected in implementation code.
- Current Scene was verified to combine prompt/generation/media/chain responsibilities.
- No canonical runtime StoryGraph, MacroStoryBeat, SceneDramaticBeat, Shot, Shot IR, or production prompt compiler was found.
- Current story state is primarily project.story plus procedural skill instructions.
- Current continuity is primarily media/reference chaining, not a narrative/world-state continuity ledger.
- Current QA reviewer returns structured video findings but does not persist a canonical QA/Repair artifact chain.
- Test source was inventoried; 323 pytest test functions plus an MV3 bootstrap regression script were observed. Tests were NOT executed in this phase.
- docs/CHATCODE_GLOBAL_MULTI_PROJECT_EXECUTION_LAW.md is currently a bootstrap placeholder; no additional detailed law text has yet been imported into that file.

### Discovery artifacts created

- docs/research/repo-audits/FLOWKIT_CURRENT_STATE_ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md
- docs/research/findings/FLOWKIT_TO_AI_FILM_STUDIO_GAP_MATRIX.md

### Scope state

- Feature code changes: none.
- Dependency installation: none.
- Build execution: none.
- Test execution: none.
- Commit: none.
- Detailed canonical Studio design import: not started.
- Implementation feature task creation: not started.

### Evidence policy

No PASS status is asserted for runtime behavior because no build/test/live execution was requested or performed in this phase.

previous_stage = HISTORICAL DESIGN CORPUS EXPANDED / PRE-CONSOLIDATION

### Verified

- 16/16 historical version snapshots V0.1 through V0.16 extracted and verified.
- Historical entries remain version-separated under `docs/historical/chat-design-corpus/expanded/V0_01` through `V0_16`.
- Historical design files were not edited.
- No deduplication or Master canonical merge was performed.
- Post-V0.16 canonical merge candidates remain at corpus top level.
- `HISTORICAL_EXPANSION_MANIFEST.md` records per-version integrity, counts, presence checks, and global duplicate/byte-identical inventory.

### Scope state

- Feature code changes: none.
- Dependency installation: none.
- Build execution: none.

## Current Stage ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â 2026-09-22

previous_stage = PRE-MASTER AUTHORITY RESOLUTION / BLOCKED

### Verified authority audit

- Entire expanded historical corpus V0.1 through V0.16 was inventoried by normalized logical path and SHA-256.
- 142 logical documents are covered when the 137 historical logical paths are combined with 5 top-level post/standalone sources.
- 85 historical logical families are byte-identical across all appearances.
- 38 historical logical families contain evolved content.
- 161 physical SHA-256 duplicate-content groups were identified without physical deduplication.
- Explicit supersession and split/extension lineage was mapped from ADRs, state/handoff lineage, review decisions, contradiction audit, registries and actual contract changes.
- Required Primary candidate sources: 22.
- Required Supporting sources: 17.
- Historical-only standalone sources: 2.
- Superseded semantics/families excluded from current-authority merge: 12.
- Unresolved unique conflicts: 7.
- Blocking authority decision groups: 5.
- No canonical Master was created.

### Exact blocking areas

1. Credential Broker / secret-storage authority status.
2. Universal BrainPack / ActiveProductionProfile ownership and precedence.
3. Narrative Expansion artifact identity and relation to Story/Sequence/Scene identities.
4. MacroStoryBeat / SceneDramaticBeat plus Directing/Blocking/Cinematography authority chain.
5. Shot identity / ShotListManifest / FullShotSpec / ShotSpec / ShotIR boundary.

### Scope state

- Feature code changes: none.
- Dependency installation: none.
- Build execution: none.
- Test execution: none.
- Commit: none.
- Physical historical deduplication: none.
- Historical file deletion: none.
- Master canonical consolidation: blocked / not started.
- Implementation coding tasks: not authorized.

## Current Stage ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â 2026-09-22

previous_stage = PRE-MASTER AUTHORITY MAP COMPLETE

### Accepted pre-Master authority decisions

- ADR-0016: Host Security Broker is canonical credential authority; Electron Main + safeStorage is target long-lived secret owner; Utility gets scoped short-lived leases; Renderer has no long-lived secret authority; FlowKit auth/session is compatibility-only.
- ADR-0017: one BrainPack Registry, one Profile Resolver, immutable pinned ActiveProductionProfile; hard constraints/locked invariants outrank soft/project preferences; downstream does not independently resolve packs.
- ADR-0018: canonical narrative identities are StoryCore ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ MacroStoryBeat ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Sequence ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Scene ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ SceneDramaticBeat; no generic persistent Beat; SceneList/SceneBreakdown are manifests/projections only.
- ADR-0019: canonical dramatic-to-camera authority chain is fixed from SceneDramaticBeat through AudienceExperienceTarget, DirectingIntent, SceneSpatialDramaticContract, BlockingPlan and CinematographyObjective to ShotListItem; camera cannot self-author.
- ADR-0020: ShotListItem originates canonical shot_id; FullShotSpec realizes the same shot_id; legacy generic ShotSpec has no independent authority; ShotIR is provider-neutral derivative referencing shot_id; provider prompt/request is never canonical truth.

### Authority audit result

- PRE_MASTER_AUTHORITY_COVERAGE_AUDIT_V2 = PASS.
- Unique decision conflicts tracked: 20.
- Resolved/principle-set: 18.
- Unresolved unique conflicts: 2.
- Blocking unresolved conflicts: 0.
- Non-blocking unresolved conflicts: 2.
- PM-014 Compiler ownership remains consolidation work, not blocker.
- PM-020 Sequence QA contract remains consolidation work, not blocker.

### Scope state

previous_stage = MASTER IMPLEMENTATION BASELINE CANDIDATE

### Canonical consolidation result

- Master path: docs/design/canonical/MASTER_AI_FILM_STUDIO_FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_BASELINE_V1.md
- Master status: IMPLEMENTATION BASELINE CANDIDATE ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â NOT YET FROZEN.
- Canonical numbered sections: 103 (00 through 102).
- Directly consolidated unique sources: 56.
- Superseded semantic families excluded as current authority: at least 12.
- Historical-only standalone architecture/audit sources excluded from direct current authority: 2.
- Byte-identical historical copies were not re-merged.
- PM-014 Compiler ownership: RESOLVED IN MASTER Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§64.
- PM-020 Sequence QA: RESOLVED IN MASTER Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§77.
- MASTER_CONSOLIDATION_SELF_AUDIT_V1 = PASS.
- Unresolved canonical conflicts: 0.
- Blocking conflicts: 0.

### Important source-normalization decision

The source corpus defines canonical semantic Shot layers L1ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“L8. It does not define authoritative semantic L9ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“L12.
The Master therefore preserves L1ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“L8 and uses T9ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“T12 only as downstream technical realization aliases (Static Keyframe, Motion Delta, ShotIR, Provider Compilation), not invented semantic layers.

### Open V2 findings

- FM2-001 - accepted post-V0.16 requirement IDs point to missing explicit contracts for SequencePlan, DurationBudget, SceneBudget, NarrativeTrace and ShotExpansion.
- FM2-002 - GenerationJob exact enums/owners are restored, but complete legal transition relation remains under-specified.
- FM2-003 - Ã‚Â§01 full component-contract completeness is not satisfied across many canonical components outside Ã‚Â§06-Ã‚Â§41.
- FM2-004 - Topic Intelligence incorrectly depends on Profile Resolver, creating bootstrap authority/order cycle.
- FM2-005 - StoryCore and StoryGraph inputs create a direct authority/order cycle.
- FM2-006 - required Narrative Expansion defect-code registry is missing.
- FM2-007 - Ã‚Â§102 has malformed literal \n row separators for 21 historical requirement IDs.
- FM2-008 - Ã‚Â§100 self-status wording is stale after independent Audit V2.
